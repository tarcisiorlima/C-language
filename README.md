# C-language
This is a repository to record my studies about the use of C language for embedded microcontroller/microprocessor firmware development. The following courses are ministrated by Microchip University, an initiative from Microchip, a top level semiconductor manufacturer, to deliver technical knowledge to its customers and partners.

Course 1 - Syntax and Structure of C

This  class will enable you to begin writing embedded C language firmware for microcontrollers. Most major C language constructs will be covered, including variables, constants, operators, expressions and statements, decision functionality, loops, functions, arrays, multi-file projects, and data pointers. You will learn all of these C language topics from a non-hardware framework so that you can focus on learning the C language instead of the microcontroller architecture. The presentation will be accompanied by instructor-led code demonstrations that will be conducted with the powerful MPLAB® simulator. Skills learned in this class will be applicable to any ANSI C compiler.  At the end of the class, you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to program a microcontroller to perform basic input and output functionality and control. You will also use the MPLAB® X IDE to perform actual debugging on a microcontroller and execute some basic debugging techniques. While not required, previous experience with any programming language or experience with microcontrollers would be helpful.

The course will cover:
. Variables
. Constants
. Operators
. Decision Making
. Functions
. Comments
. Loops
. Multi-File projects
. Arrays
. Data Pointers
. Macros
